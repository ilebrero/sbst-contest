\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.

% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Automated unit test generation can support developers and testers, produce regression test suites, and is an enabler for dynamic program analyses. The annual unit test generation contest aims to foster research and development of automated unit test generators. 
This paper describes the results obtained by the EvoSuite's DSE module's \cite{TesisIgnacio} test generation tool in this competition. 
EvosuiteDSE uses dynamic symbolic execution to systematically explore different execution paths of a given program by recollecting constraints about an execution, modifying them to express a new not explored execution path and generating new inputs using a SMT-solver to solve the new path constraints. In the 9th instance of the competition at the International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) 2021, Evosuite achieved and overall score of 47.14, which was the lowest among the competition and baseline tools \cite{SBST2021}. This paper describes the results obtained by EvoSuiteDSE in this competition.

\section{EvoSuiteDSE}

Evosuite is a Java search-based unit test generation tool \cite{evosuite} which contains a dynamic symbolic execution module that can be used as both an enhancer for search-based generation \cite{ImprovingSBSTWithDSE} or for running a pure dynamic symbolic execution approach. Table 1 summarizes the features of EvoSuite in the standard format of the SBST unit testing competition: Given just the Java classpath containing all compiled dependencies and the name of a class under test, EvoSuiteDSE automatically generates a set of JUnit test cases aimed at maximizing code coverage. EvoSuiteDSE can only be used on the command line at the moment.

Throughout its development, two exploration algorithms were evaluated, starting with a depth-first search when experimented on enhancing the search-based algorithm \cite{ImprovingSBSTWithDSE}. 

% Evosuite's encoding of test cases for the generation consists of variable-length sequences of java statements (e.g. primitive statements and calls on the class under test).

Recently, the DSE module was rewritten in order to decouple it from the existing evolutionary framework found in the tool and to enable the tool to use a pure concolic approach \cite{TesisIgnacio}. 
In this work, the exploration algorithm was changed to a generational search one (In the same fashion as SAGE\cite{SAGE} but using incremental branch coverage instead of incremental block coverage) and two encoding of uni-dimensional arrays support were added to the engine. 
The first array encoding uses arrays theory while the second one, which was named \textit{lazy variables}, models each entry in the array as an independent symbolic element using uninterpreted functions. 
Memory wise, the \textit{lazy variable} implementation should perform better, as symbolic expressions are created on demand as the array is accessed and single variables should be easier to solve than arrays theory expressions (this approach results in the loose of completeness due to the fact that the array access index's symbolic value is concretized when used). 
Currently, the engine can reason about integers (int, long, short, boolean, byte and char), reals (float and double), partially about strings and arrays using the Z3 or CVC4 SMT-solvers. 
In addition, the engine partially supports a few dynamic language features found in recent versions of the JDK that use the \texttt{Invokedynamic} bytecode instruction, such as lambdas and string concatenation.

After the search has used up the available search budget (or alternatively, has achieved 100\% coverage of all coverage objectives), EvoSuite applies various post-search optimizations aimed to improve the readability of the generated tests \cite{evosuite, evosuitechallenge}, such as minimization and addition of test assertions using mutation analysis\cite{mutationDrivenOracles}. 
It also checks all generated tests for compile errors (which may be the result of bugs in EvoSuite) or flakiness caused by non-determinism in the class under test, not covered by EvoSuite's extensive instrumentation.

As EvoSuiteDSE is in an early development stage, it has been preliminary evaluated \cite{TesisIgnacio} and several mayor features remain future work, such as complex objects support.

\section{Tool setup}

The configuration for EvoSuiteDSE for the 2021 competition is largely based on Evosuite's default values since these have been tuned extensively for non-DSE purposes \cite{tuning}. 
The exploration algorithm used was generational search \cite{SAGE} and the arrays implementation was \textit{lazy variables}. 
On the solver side, CVC4 was used.

The test minimization step used by EvoSuite is computationally expensive, but it was enabled in the competition because minimized tests are less likely to expose flakiness. 
However, we aimed to reduce the post-processing time by including all regression assertions rather than filtering them with mutation analysis \cite{mutationDrivenOracles}. While this makes test cases less readable and potentially more brittle with respect to future changes in the software under test, neither of these aspects is evaluated as part of the SBST contest.

EvoSuite uses different phases (e.g., initialization, search, minimization, assertion generation, compilation check, removal of flaky tests). Like in previous competitions where the search-based configuration was presented, we allocated 50\% of the overall time set by the competition organizers for the search, and distributed the other 50\% equally to the remaining phases.

\section{Benchmark results}
Table 2 summarizes the results achieved by EvoSuiteDSE on the competition classes for the \textit{GUAVA} project and search budgets. In general, EvoSuiteDSE did not perform well compared to the other tools.
This is due to the fact that in its current release, EvoSuiteDSE can only create test cases that directly invoke the static methods of the target classes. 
And whenever a non primitive data type or string is required, the only value passed by EvoSuiteDSE is null.    
Interestingly, all search budgets (30s, 120s and 300s) performed exactly the same (except for \textit{com.google.common.math.Quantiles} which resulted in 0 line, branch and mutation coverage when running for 30s), this may suggest that the exploration space reachable by the tool is relatively small given the current elements that the engine can reason about.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper reports on the participation of the EvoSuiteDSE test generation tool in the 9th SBST Java Unit Testing Tool Contest. Given it's premature state and with an overall score of 47.14, EvoSuiteDSE seemed to perform the worst on the CUTs selected for this year. In light of the benchmark results, implementing complex objects support seems to be the next step for the tool as a significant performance improvement is suggested.

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
